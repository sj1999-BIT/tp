### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the countdown data i.e., a `Countdown` object.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data, countdown data, and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from all `AddressBookStorage`, `CountdownStorage`, and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Delete by name feature
#### Implementation
The delete-by-name mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements `ReadOnlyAddressBook` with a person list, stored internally as an `persons`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `AddressBook#removePerson()` — Removes specified person from its person list.

The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deletePerson()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete-by-name mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and has the following person list saved. `AddressBook` stores these contacts as `persons`.

![DeleteByNamePersonList0](images/DeleteByNamePersonList0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete n/John Doe` command to delete the person named *John Doe* in the list.
The `delete` command first calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get a list where all the persons in the list named *John Doe*.

![DeleteByNameFilteredPersonList0](images/DeleteByNameFilteredPersonList0.png)

Step 3. With the access to the filtered list, it calls `Model#deletePerson()`, causing `AddressBook` to remove each person in the
list by calling `AddressBook#removePerson()`. Finally, the user will see the updated person list with *John Doe* removed.

![DeleteByNamePersonList1](images/DeleteByNamePersonList1.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a name is not found, it will not call `Model#deletePerson()`, so the `AddressBook` person list will not be modified.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete-by-name operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/John Doe` Command](images/DeleteByNameSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a set-wedding-countdown command:

<img src="images/DeleteByNameActivityDiagram.png" width="380" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How delete-by-name executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes the person with the exact same name.
    * Pros: Avoid the situation where user deletes the wrong person
    * Cons: User needs to remember the name precisely.
* **Alternative 2:** Deletes the person who names partially contains the specified name.
    * Pros: User does not have to remember the full name (e.g. `delete n/Alex` will delete both person named *Alex Tan* and *Alex Yeoh*).
    * Cons: Might delete the wrong person.

### Countdown to the wedding day feature
#### Implementation
The countdown mechanism is facilitated by `Countdown`. It implements `ReadOnlyCountdown` with a wedding date, stored internally as `weddingDate`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Countdown#setData()` — Replaces the existing wedding date with a new date.
* `Countdown#getDate()` — Returns an unmodifiable view of the wedding date.

The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setDate()` and `Model#getWeddingDate()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the countdown mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and never set wedding date before. `Countdown` automatically stores today's date as `weddingDate`. Say today is `4 November 2021`.

![SetWeddingCountdown0](images/SetWeddingCountdown0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `countdown 2022-05-20` command to set his/her wedding date to `20 May 2022`.
The `countdown` command then calls `Model#setDate()` to set the wedding date to `20 May 2022`.

![SetWeddingCountdown1](images/SetWeddingCountdown1.png)

Step 3. With this updated wedding date, the user executes `countdown` (without argument) command to see the number of 
days left until his/her wedding above the command box.

![CountdownResult](images/CountdownResult.png)

Step 4. The user can also view the countdown at the right top corner of the app immediately after updating the wedding
date.

![CountdownGUI](images/CountdownGUI.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the date specified has passed, it will 
not call `Model#setDate()`, so the `Countdown` wedding date will not be modified.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the set-wedding-date-for-countdown operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `countdown 2022-05-20` Command](images/SetWeddingCountdownSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CountdownCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete-by-name command:

<img src="images/SetWeddingCountdownActivityDiagram.png" width="400" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How setting wedding date for countdown executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Does not allow setting past date as wedding date.
    * Pros: Fit for the purpose of the app: planning for future wedding.
    * Cons: Cannot track how many days has passed since the wedding.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow setting past date as wedding date.
    * Pros: Can track how many days has passed since the wedding.
    * Cons: Does not fit for the purpose of the app: planning for future wedding.

### Cost sum checking feature
#### Implementation
The cost sum checking mechanism is facilitated by `Model`. It implements the following operation:

* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` — Filters the person list with specified condition(s).

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the cost sum checking mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and wants to check the total expenses for certain categories. Let say he/she
has the following contacts stored.

![PriceSum0](images/PriceSum0.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br>
A contact's `status` indicates whether the user has confirmed to hire this person/ the user is sure that this person will
attend his/her wedding. Therefore, based on the diagram above, the user has **confirmed** to hire `Bernice Yu` as his/her
**florist** with the cost of **300.00 dollars**.

</div>

Step 2. The user executes `price t/Florist Photographer` command to check the expenses under `Florist` and `Photographer`
category. The `price` command first calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to get all the contacts with `confirmed`
status.

![PriceSum1](images/PriceSum1.png)

Step 3. With this filtered list, `price` command then further filters out person(s) with either `Florist` or `Photographer` 
tags. Then, it calculates the total sum of `price` for each contact(s) in this filtered list.

![PriceSum2](images/PriceSum2.png)

Step 4. Finally, the user can view the calculation result right above the command box.

![PriceSumByTag](images/PriceSumByTag.png)

Step 4. The user then checks the total cost of his/her wedding by executing `price` command (without any argument). Hence,
`price` command will just sum up all the `price` for all the contacts with `confirmed` status. The only contacts with 
`confirmed` status are `Alex Yeoh` and `Bernice Yu`, respectively hired by the user with the cost **650.00 dollars** and
**300.00 dollars**. Hence, the total is **950.00** dollars.

![PriceTotalSum](images/PriceTotalSum.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the category(tag) specified is not found,
then the cost under that category is considered as **0.00 dollar** and will not be added to the sum.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the cost-sum-checking operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `price t/Florist Photographer` Command](images/PriceSumSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `PriceCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How cost-sum-checking operation executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Does not calculate the cost for those who has not confirmed yet.
    * Pros: Gives an exact number on those categories the user confirms to spend money on.
    * Cons: The total sum does not include the potential expenses, i.e. cost for persons with `pending` status.
* **Alternative 2:** Calculate the cost for those who has not confirmed yet.
    * Pros: The total sum includes the potential expenses, i.e. cost for persons with `pending` status.
    * Cons: Does not give an exact number on those categories the user confirms to spend money on.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* plans a wedding for himself/herself
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts of who will be involving/in-charged for the wedding
* prefers desktop applications over other types
* can type fast on keyboards
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable and prefers using CLI applications
* is often forgetful and needs a program that will assist him with keeping track of the wedding details

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app and more specific to wedding-planning
