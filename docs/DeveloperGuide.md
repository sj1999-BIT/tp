### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the countdown data i.e., a `Countdown` object.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data, user preference data, countdown data, and shortcut data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage`, `CountdownStorage`, and `ShortcutStorage` which means it can be treated as either of them (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* can save address book data, countdown data, shortcut data, and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find by Tag and Price feature
#### Implementation
Finding by Tag and Price is a combinatory feature implemented by `Predicates`. The predicate for tags is `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

![PredicateClasses](images/PredicateClasses.png)

Finding by price range uses three different predicates.

1. `PriceEqualsNumberPredicate` for to find equal to price
2. `PriceGreaterThanNumberPredicate` for to find greater than certain price
3. `PriceLessThanNumberPredicate` for to find less than certain price

The 5 operators =, <, >, >=, <= are implemented using the above predicates.

| Operator | Predicate |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| =  | `PriceEqualsNumberPredicate`  |
| >  | `PriceGreaterThanNumberPredicate`  |
| <  | `PriceLessThanNumberPredicate`  |
| >=  | `PriceEqualsNumberPredicate \|\| PriceGreaterThanNumberPredicate`  |
| <=  | `PriceEqualsNumberPredicate \|\| PriceLessThanNumberPredicate`  |

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find command:

<img src="images/FindByFilterActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How each predicate is combined together:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Queried list of contacts must fit all three criterias at once.
    * Pros: It is likely user would use this feature more as it narrows the scope of the query
    * Cons: Some users may misinterpret the functionality and be confused
* **Alternative 2:** Queried list of contacts can fit any of the three criterias
    * Pros: Consistent with how multiple names work with the `find [NAMES]` function
    * Cons: Less likely to be used as additional parameters won't increase effectiveness of query.

### Shortcut features
#### Implementation
The shortcut implementation is facilitated by a Shortcut module with four commands: `sc`, `addsc`, `removesc`, and `listsc`. Each responsible for the call shortcut, add shortcut, remove shortcut, and list shortcut functions respectively. 

`Shortcut` mechanism is similar to `AddressBook` but instead stores a `HashMap<String, String>` of shortcuts corresponding to its `key` and `commandString`. To store it in JSON, `JsonShortcutStorage` use `JsonSerializableShortcut` to read and write from the JSON file. The storage architecture can be seen in the diagram above.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the shortcut mechanisms behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the applicatio nand has the following person list saved. `Shortcut` stores this in the shortcutMap.

![Shortcuts0](images/Shortcuts0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `sc f` to call the shortcut `f` leading to the command `find pr/>0.00` to be called. The `sc` command first calls `Model#getShortcutFromKey()` to obtain the command from the model.

Step 3. The `sc` command takes this new command and parses it in the `AddressBookParser`. If this succeeds command in the `commandString` is executed on the same model.  

Below is a simplified sequence diagram showing how a `ShortcutCommand` would interact with the logic component. The interactions of the `FindCommand` stored in the `commandString` is simpified as the main focus of this diagram is the shortcut functionality.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sc f` Command](images/ShortcutCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a shortcut-keyword command:

<img src="images/ShortcutActivityDiagram.png" width="400" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: When to check if shortcut command is valid:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check when it is called by `sc`
    * Pros: Less intensive on the system. User can still check if command is correct by eye using `listsc`
    * Cons: User needs to make sure they add the correct command themselves
* **Alternative 2:** Check when it is added by `addsc`
    * Pros: User can avoid the case where they add an invalid command
    * Cons: Bug Prone. Commands may have runtime errors depending on the state of the `AddressBook` (Unable to tell if command is invalid). 

### Delete by name feature
#### Implementation
The delete-by-name mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements `ReadOnlyAddressBook` with a person list, stored internally as an `persons`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `AddressBook#removePerson()`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes specified person from its person list.

The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deletePerson()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete-by-name mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and has the following person list saved. `AddressBook` stores these contacts as `persons`.

![DeleteByNamePersonList0](images/DeleteByNamePersonList0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete n/John Doe` command to delete the person named *John Doe* in the list.
The `delete` command first calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get a list where all the persons in the list named *John Doe*.

![DeleteByNameFilteredPersonList0](images/DeleteByNameFilteredPersonList0.png)

Step 3. With the access to the filtered list, it calls `Model#deletePerson()`, causing `AddressBook` to remove each person in the
list by calling `AddressBook#removePerson()`. Finally, the user will see the updated person list with *John Doe* removed.

![DeleteByNamePersonList1](images/DeleteByNamePersonList1.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a name is not found, it will not call `Model#deletePerson()`, so the `AddressBook` person list will not be modified.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete-by-name operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/John Doe` Command](images/DeleteByNameSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a set-wedding-countdown command:

<img src="images/DeleteByNameActivityDiagram.png" width="380" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How delete-by-name executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes the person with the exact same name.
    * Pros: Avoid the situation where user deletes the wrong person
    * Cons: User needs to remember the name precisely.
* **Alternative 2:** Deletes the person who names partially contains the specified name.
    * Pros: User does not have to remember the full name (e.g. `delete n/Alex` will delete both person named *Alex Tan* and *Alex Yeoh*).
    * Cons: Might delete the wrong person.

### Countdown to the wedding day feature
#### Implementation
The countdown mechanism is facilitated by `Countdown`. It implements `ReadOnlyCountdown` with a wedding date, stored internally as `weddingDate`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Countdown#setData()`â€‰â€”â€‰Replaces the existing wedding date with a new date.
* `Countdown#getDate()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns an unmodifiable view of the wedding date.

The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setDate()` and `Model#getWeddingDate()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the countdown mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and never set wedding date before. `Countdown` automatically stores today's date as `weddingDate`. Say today is `4 November 2021`.

![SetWeddingCountdown0](images/SetWeddingCountdown0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `countdown 2022-05-20` command to set his/her wedding date to `20 May 2022`.
The `countdown` command then calls `Model#setDate()` to set the wedding date to `20 May 2022`.

![SetWeddingCountdown1](images/SetWeddingCountdown1.png)

Step 3. With this updated wedding date, the user executes `countdown` (without argument) command to see the number of 
days left until his/her wedding above the command box.

![CountdownResult](images/CountdownResult.png)

Step 4. The user can also view the countdown at the right top corner of the app immediately after updating the wedding
date.

![CountdownGUI](images/CountdownGUI.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the date specified has passed, it will 
not call `Model#setDate()`, so the `Countdown` wedding date will not be modified.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the set-wedding-date-for-countdown operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `countdown 2022-05-20` Command](images/SetWeddingCountdownSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CountdownCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete-by-name command:

<img src="images/SetWeddingCountdownActivityDiagram.png" width="400" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How setting wedding date for countdown executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Does not allow setting past date as wedding date.
    * Pros: Fit for the purpose of the app: planning for future wedding.
    * Cons: Cannot track how many days has passed since the wedding.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow setting past date as wedding date.
    * Pros: Can track how many days has passed since the wedding.
    * Cons: Does not fit for the purpose of the app: planning for future wedding.

### Cost sum checking feature
#### Implementation
The cost sum checking mechanism is facilitated by `Model`. It implements the following operation:

* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`â€‰â€”â€‰Filters the person list with specified condition(s).

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the cost sum checking mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and wants to check the total expenses for certain categories. Let say he/she
has the following contacts stored.

![PriceSum0](images/PriceSum0.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br>
A contact's `status` indicates whether the user has confirmed to hire this person/ the user is sure that this person will
attend his/her wedding. Therefore, based on the diagram above, the user has **confirmed** to hire `Bernice Yu` as his/her
**florist** with the cost of **300.00 dollars**.

</div>

Step 2. The user executes `price t/Florist Photographer` command to check the expenses under `Florist` and `Photographer`
category. The `price` command first calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to get all the contacts with `confirmed`
status.

![PriceSum1](images/PriceSum1.png)

Step 3. With this filtered list, `price` command then further filters out person(s) with either `Florist` or `Photographer` 
tags. Then, it calculates the total sum of `price` for each contact(s) in this filtered list.

![PriceSum2](images/PriceSum2.png)

Step 4. Finally, the user can view the calculation result right above the command box.

![PriceSumByTag](images/PriceSumByTag.png)

Step 4. The user then checks the total cost of his/her wedding by executing `price` command (without any argument). Hence,
`price` command will just sum up all the `price` for all the contacts with `confirmed` status. The only contacts with 
`confirmed` status are `Alex Yeoh` and `Bernice Yu`, respectively hired by the user with the cost **650.00 dollars** and
**300.00 dollars**. Hence, the total is **950.00** dollars.

![PriceTotalSum](images/PriceTotalSum.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the category(tag) specified is not found,
then the cost under that category is considered as **0.00 dollar** and will not be added to the sum.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the cost-sum-checking operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `price t/Florist Photographer` Command](images/PriceSumSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `PriceCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How cost-sum-checking operation executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Does not calculate the cost for those who has not confirmed yet.
    * Pros: Gives an exact number on those categories the user confirms to spend money on.
    * Cons: The total sum does not include the potential expenses, i.e. cost for persons with `pending` status.
* **Alternative 2:** Calculate the cost for those who has not confirmed yet.
    * Pros: The total sum includes the potential expenses, i.e. cost for persons with `pending` status.
    * Cons: Does not give an exact number on those categories the user confirms to spend money on.

### Delete By Tag feature

#### Implementation

The delete by tag mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`, which implements `ReadOnlyAddressBook`. 
Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `AddressBook#removePerson()`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes specified person from `person` list in address book

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deletePerson()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete by tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the
`person` list consisting of all contacts (image adapted from Delete-by-name section).

![DeleteByTagState0](images/DeleteByNamePersonList0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete t/friends` command to delete contacts consisting of the friends tag. The `delete` command first calls 
`Model#getFilteredPersonList()` and then iterates through the given list to filter out `person` objects that have the friends tag. While doing so, relevant
`person` objects are placed into a separate list known as `deletedlist`. Assuming that Alex Yeoh and Bernice Yu are the only contacts with the friends tag, 
the deletedlist is updated as follows.

![DeleteByTagState1](images/DeletedList.png)

Step 3. The `delete` command then fully iterates through `deletedlist`, and calls `Model#deletePerson()` at each iteration to remove 
every person identified as part of the `deletedlist` from the `AddressBook`.

![DeleteByTagState2](images/DeleteByTagAfter.png)

Step 4. Once the contacts have been successfully deleted, a command result indicating that contacts under friends tag has been removed is reproduced in the command box.

![DeleteByTagState3](images/DeleteByTagCommandResult.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the tag is not present in the `AddressBook`, 
then the `delete` command throws an error message that specifies that contacts with such a tag do not exist in the `AddressBook`.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete by tag operation works:

![DeleteByTagSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteByTagSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `Delete by Tag` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new delete by tag command:

<img src="images/DeleteByTagActivityDiagram.png" width="380" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How delete by tag executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes all contacts with tag.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May be inconvenient for users who wish to delete selected range of contacts (e.g. delete pending contacts under friends).

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes selected contacts within tag.
    * Pros: Increases ease of deleting multiple contacts with different statuses for user
    * Cons: Difficult to implement, and could potentially add confusion with an increase in syntax required to 
      differentiate various functions for delete.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Report feature (Status)

#### Implementation
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**<br>
The following details on implementation only cover the information on how the status count across different tags
is computed within the report. Implementation details regarding expenditure calculations and overall contact status count are left out.
</div>

The report mechanism is facilitated by `Model`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`â€‰â€”â€‰Provides`person` list in address book based on the predicate provided

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the report behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the
`person` list consisting of all contacts (image adapted from Delete-by-name section).

![Report0](images/DeleteByNamePersonList0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `report` command to view the status (and expenditure) across all tags. The `report` command calls
`Model#getFilteredPersonList()` and then iterates through the given list to filter out tags and check the respective status count for each tag (i.e. number of confirmed, pending and declined contacts associated with each tag).
While doing so, each tag and the status count associated with it is stored within a `reportElement` which is placed and regularly updated in a separate arraylist known as `reportArray`. 
Assuming that the following is the details for the contacts stored,

* Alex Yeoh: Tag is friends and status is pending
* Bernice Yu: Tag is friends and status is confirmed
* John Doe: Tag is caterer and status is declined

the diagram below would be expected.

![Report1](images/ReportArray.png)

Step 3. The `report` command then fully iterates through the `reportArray`, and produces a text report of the different tags identified
as well as their respective status counts (in the form of a popup window).

![Report2](images/ReportWindowStatus.png)

Step 4. After that, a command result indicating that the report window is opened is reproduced in the command box.

![Report3](images/ReportResponse.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How report executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Produces status for tags and expenditure in a text form.
    * Pros: Easy to understand and implement the report.
    * Cons: May be inconvenient for users to read through the entire report when the number of tags and contacts is very high.

* **Alternative 2:** Produces graphical representation of report
    * Pros: Enables user to better visualise status of different tags
    * Cons: Could be difficult to interpret graph if user uses a large range of tags with various statuses.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Undo feature

The undo mechanism is facilitated by an Undo module and is prompted by the command `undo`. This command 
is used for undoing the most recent change made to the program. 

It uses the `ReadOnlyAddressBook` interface to retrieve the list of people stored as contacts. 
The undo mechanism invokes the following operations:

* `AddressBook#removePerson()`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes the specific person from the list of people.
* `AddressBook#setPerson()`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds the specific person to the list of people.

The above operations are represented by the Model interface in the UndoCommand class as `Model#deletePerson()` and
`Model#setPerson()` respectively.

To undo a task, the undo class keeps track of what the previous command is through the method `Undo#setPreviousCommand`,
and when the `undo` command is inputted, it checks what the previous command (static variable prevCommand)) was and 
whether it can be undone.

As of now, the `undo` command will revert the action of an `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear` or `group` command. Other
commands cannot be undone (due to their nature) or have not been implemented.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The AddressBook person list is shown below.

![UndoState1](images/UndoState1.png)

The prevCommand variable is set to nothing, as no previous command has been made.

![UndoState0](images/UndoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `edit 1 s/Confirmed` command to change the status of the first person in the book to confirmed.
The `edit` command called will invoke `Model#setPerson()` to make the changes to the AddressBook person list.

![UndoState2](images/UndoState2.png)

The prevCommand variable will now be assigned to this EditCommand object.

![UndoState3](images/UndoState3.png)

Step 3. The user executes `delete 1` to delete the first person in the group.
The `delete` command will call `Model#deletePerson()`, making a change to the AddressBook person list once again.

![UndoState4](images/UndoState4.png)

The prevCommand variable will now be assigned to this DeleteCommand object.

![UndoState5](images/UndoState5.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
If a command is invalid, it will not call `Model#setPerson()` or 
`Model#deletePerson()`, and the prevCommand value will be set to null.
</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that deleting the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. 
The `undo` command will call `Model#setPerson()`, which will revert the AddressBook person list to the 
previous state as a result of re-adding the contact at the exact same location.

![UndoState0](images/UndoState1.png)

The prevCommand variable is also updated to equal the UndoCommand object.

![UndoState6](images/UndoState6.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works (for undoing a delete command):

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the AddressBook person list
such as `list`, will just output a message stating that such a command cannot be undone.

Step 6. The user wants to use undo on the `shortcut` command, in which case the program will output that undo
has not been implemented for such a command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
If a command is valid but cannot be undone, the prevCommand value will still be
set to the command but upon evaluation the undo action will not be performed.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user tries to undo a command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Having an undo class to execute the command.
  * Pros: Easy to keep track of what the previous command is.
  * Cons: as the number of commands increase, the harder it is to keep track
     of undoing all commands in one place.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
  * Pros: No need to store several commands' undoing operations in one class,
    can have one undo operation (method) for each command.
  * Cons: May be harder to keep track of what the previous command is.
* **Alternative 3:** Store various states of the AddressBook.
  * Pros: Easy to retrieve.
  * Cons: Memory issues, when to delete an old (no longer useful) state.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* plans a wedding for himself/herself
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts of who will be involving/in-charged for the wedding
* prefers desktop applications over other types
* can type fast on keyboards
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable and prefers using CLI applications
* is often forgetful and needs a program that will assist him with keeping track of the wedding details

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app and more specific to wedding-planning

### Saving data

1. **Dealing with missing/corrupted data files**

   1. Simulating a corrupted file:
      * In the app's home folder, look for a folder named `data`, double click into it, then look for a file named `countdown.json`.
      * If the file is not found, launches your app and type the command: `countdown`.
      * Open the file and modify the `month` to `TEST` of the countdown as shown below, then save it:
        ![ModifyCountdownJson](images/ModifyCountdownJSON.png)
      * If your app is open now, close it.
   
   2. Expected behavior:<br>
      * Relaunches the app and you will see the following displayed in the status message. It means the original corrupted `countdown.json` will be replaced 
        with the new one the next time `countdown` command is used. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
        ![CorruptedCountdownBehavior](images/CorruptedCountdownBehavior.png)
      * Use `countdown` command, then reopen the `countdown.json`. You will see the `month` has been changed to today's month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Effort**

1. **Difficulty level:**<br>
   * This project has the medium high level of difficulty as all of our developers has to handle this project in the time
     of pandemic. It means that all of us have to work from home, thus making the communication harder and reduce the
     productivity.
   * Furthermore, all of us has no prior experience of handling brown field project, and has very little experience in 
     using JavaFX. Most of the tools used are learnt on the spot and apply directly to the project.
   * Last but not least, this project has a very tight time constraint.

2. **Challenges faced:**<br>
   * Difficulty in communication: All discussions are through Zoom(a software used for online meeting) comes with the risk of slow internet connection and issue in microphone.
   * Responsibilities outside the project: Most of us has other responsibilities to deal with, limiting us from dedicating more time for this project.

3. **Effort required:**<br>
   * Coordinating with all the developers' schedule.
   * Learn the convention of writing a proper documentation.
   * Learn the tools such as JavaFX from scratch and apply directly.

4. **Achievements of the project:**<br>
