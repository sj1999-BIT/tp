3    | Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.                                                                     | `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

  have confirmed to hire a person to help with your wedding. In the case you choose not to specify the status, it is set to `pending` by default.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Tip:**<br>
* A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
* Since a wedding can be big and two or more people might come from the same family, all contact information (other than
  the contact's name) can be duplicated.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Tips:**<br>
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. It must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
