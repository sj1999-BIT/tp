### Project: WedFast

WedFast is a desktop address book application used for managing contacts of your dream wedding. The user interacts with
it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find by tags and price range.
  * What it does: Allows the user to find contacts by their tags and their prices.
  * Justification: This features improves the product by allowing the user to enhance their query and find what they are looking for with more accuracy. 
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing `find` command. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives and the implementation was expanded upon greatly. Text analysis of the price operators were fairly challenging to implement.  

* **New Feature**: Added a shortcut command feature
  * What it does: Calls a shortcut command linked to a keyword.
  * Justification: The shortcut feature and its accompanying commands serves to increase the productivity of the user. By saving long commands that are reusable (eg. a specific find query) to a fast and short command, the user is able to customize their commands and save time.
  * Highlights: This new feature required a whole additional module to the app in order to store shortcuts in a JSON format. The implementation is similar to the original storing of the address book, but a new data structure and accompanying features had to be coded to allow the user to ensure that their shortcuts did not go away. 

* **New Feature**: Added the add shortcut command feature
  * What it does: Allows the user to add a shortcut to their list of shortcuts.
  * Justification: This is an accompanying feature for the shortcut feature. 

* **New Feature**: Added the remove shortcut command feature
  * What it does: Allows the user to remove a shortcut from their list of shortcuts.
  * Justification: This is an accompanying feature for the shortcut feature. 

* **New Feature**: Added the list shortcut command feature
  * What it does: Allows the user to view their list of shortcuts.
  * Justification: This is an accompanying feature for the shortcut feature.
